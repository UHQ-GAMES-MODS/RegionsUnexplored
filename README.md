# Regions Unexplored

Regions Unexplored is a mod that adds upon new biomes in the Overworld and the Nether. Which counts for around 70 and more are underway!

## Version policy

We generally have a LTS version (aka a stable modded version where a lot of modders are at with releasing mods) and a latest version so people who play on those versions can also play with regions unexplored!
